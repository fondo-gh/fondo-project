Undefined capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions as set forth in our Terms of Use.

            How this Policy applies
            This Privacy Policy explains how Fondo collects, uses, or otherwise processes information, including information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”) and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of such information when you use our Website: https://www.fondo.com/, including on a mobile device, mobile application and related services (the “Service“ or the “Services”) or any other service to which this policy is linked. Your use of our Website and the Services is also governed by our Terms of Use posted at: https://www.indiegogo.com/about/terms (“Terms“), which are to be read in conjunction with this policy.
            
            Who is the Data Controller?
            Fondo, Inc. is the “data controller” of personal data collected by all of Fondo, and Fondo, Inc. is responsible for deciding how personal data is collected, used, and disclosed. Campaign Owners may also be data controllers of certain data you provide to Campaign Owners when you make a Contribution to a Campaign or through any other Services.
            
            You should be aware that when you provide information to us using a third-party site or platform, the information you provide may be separately collected by the third-party site or platform. The information we collect is covered by the Indiegogo Privacy Policy only, and the information the third-party site or platform collects is subject to the third-party site or platform’s privacy practices. Privacy choices you have made on the third-party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our Site or Services. Please also keep in mind that our Site and Services may contain links to other sites not owned or controlled by us and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site or Services and to read the policies of other sites that may collect your personal information.
            
            Data you provide to us
            We collect information you provide directly to us, information from third parties, and information that we collect through automated means. For example, we collect:
            
            Registration information you provide when you create an account or a Campaign, enter a promotion, or link your profile on a third-party site or platform with your registration account, such as your first name and last name, country of residence, gender, date of birth, email address, username, and password.
            Transaction information you provide when you request information, contact Indiegogo, create a Campaign, or make a Contribution to a Campaign.
            Information you provide in public forums on our sites and applications, such as your public posts.
            Information sent directly to another User, post, or similar functionality, where we are permitted by applicable law to collect this information.
            Information we obtain from a third party, such as a site or platform provider, about use of our applications on third-party platforms or devices.
            Location information, including location information provided by a mobile or other device interacting with one of our sites or applications (including through beacon technologies), or associated with your IP address, where we are permitted by law to process this information.
            Activity information about your use, and the use by any person(s) you authorize through your account, of our sites and applications, such as the content you view or post, how often you use our services, and your preferences.
            Usage, viewing, technical, and device data when you visit our sites, use our applications on third-party sites or platforms, or open emails we send, including your browser or device type, unique device identifier, and IP address.
            You may decline to provide us with your information. However, this will limit your ability to register for an account or use our Services. You may pledge to a project as a User by providing only an email address. However, to adjust your pledge, save payment details for future pledges, make project comments and take most other actions on our Site, you will need to finish creating an account. You may review, change or remove your information through your account settings.
            
            How we collect information
            We collect information you provide to us when you request or purchase products, services, or information from us, register with us (including when you link your profile on a third-party site or platform with your registration account), participate in public forums or other activities on our sites and applications, respond to User surveys, or otherwise interact with us online or offline.
            We collect information through a variety of technologies, such as cookies, Flash cookies, pixels, tags, software development kits, application program interfaces, and Web beacons, including when you visit our sites and applications or use our applications on third-party sites or platforms using one or more devices, whether or not you are logged in or registered. Please visit our Cookie Policy for further information, including Do Not Track and how to disable cookies and otherwise make choices with respect to such data collection.
            We collect information using analytics tools, including when you visit our sites and applications or use our applications on third-party sites or platforms.
            We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically, such as when we validate postal address information using third party services. Applicable law may require that you authorize the third party to share your information with us before we can acquire it.
            If you access the Service through a third-party connection or log-in (like a social network), we may collect certain information from your social network profile. For a description of how social networking sites handle your information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use, which may permit you to modify your privacy settings. If you do not want to share information from your social network profile, do not access the Service through that third-party service.
