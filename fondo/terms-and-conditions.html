        <h4>Terms and Conditions</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            Welcome to Fondo! By using this Site and the Services, in addition to any Additional Policies applicable to any particular features, Content and functionality of the Services (incorporated into the Terms by reference), offered by Fondo, Inc., Users agree to be bound by these Terms.
            Voluntary Contributions. All Contributions are made voluntarily and at the sole discretion and risk of the Contributor.
            No Guarantee. The date to deliver a Perk is an estimate by the Campaign Owner (not Fondo) and there is no guarantee that the Campaign Owner will fulfill and deliver the Perk by that date. Indiegogo does not guarantee or represent that Contributions will be used as promised, that Campaign Owners will deliver Perks, or that the Campaign will achieve its goals. Fondo also does not endorse, guarantee, make representations, or provide warranties regarding the quality, safety, morality or legality of any Campaign, Perk or Contribution, or the truth or accuracy of User Content posted on the Services.
            Limited Refund. Indiegogo offers a limited refund to Contributors, subject to the Refund Policy, only where the Campaign has not ended, the Contributor has not received a Perk (as confirmed by Fondo), and the Contribution has not been sent to the Campaign Owner. Fondo does not offer refunds outside Our Refund Policy, but may do so under our sole discretion. Where refunds are not available under the Refund Policy, a Contributor may contact the Campaign Owner directly to request a refund. Fondo has no obligation to participate or become involved in any dispute between Contributor and Campaign Owner concerning a refund.
            Credit Card Charges. When you Contribute to a Campaign, your card will be charged the amount of the Contribution after you confirm and submit your payment information.
            Communications Between Campaign Owners and Contributors. Once you have made a Contribution to a Campaign, the Campaign Owners may need to contact you to obtain additional information such as shipping address, specific preferences for a Perk (for example, color or size of a t-shirt), or may ask for feedback on the Campaign or the Perk. In some instances, to receive the Perk, you may need to provide requested information within a specific time frame to receive the Perk, not doing so may result in your forfeiting the Perk. Campaign Owners should not ask for information that is not required to fulfill a Perk, including personal information such as Social Security numbers or credit card/banking information. Please contact us here if you receive a request for information that appears to be excessive.
            Taxes are your responsibility.Contributors bear the sole responsibility for determining how to treat their Contributions and receipt of any Perks for tax purposes. Fondo does not offer any advice or take any responsibility for how Contributors treat their Contributions or for any financial consequences arising out of such treatment.
